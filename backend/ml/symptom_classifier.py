"""
Local Symptom Classifier — Lightweight ML model for symptom triage.

Uses a pre-trained TF-IDF + Logistic Regression classifier to predict
the medical category of a symptom description. Runs entirely on-device.

Categories (heart-focused for MVP):
  - cardiac_emergency    → Acute MI, unstable angina, aortic dissection
  - cardiac_chronic      → CAD, heart failure, valvular disease
  - cardiac_arrhythmia   → AFib, SVT, bradycardia
  - cardiac_risk         → Hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes-related CV risk
  - non_cardiac          → Likely not heart-related (GI, MSK, respiratory, anxiety)
